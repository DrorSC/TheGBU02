A social network app for android (currently)

On early stages.

Current version includes base application:
Main activity - the "wall" with posts (to be seen in the future)
Login screen - currently only mail + password. (Future update will include Facebook, Twitter?, Google+?)
Register - based on mail + password connection with FireBase user control.
Profile - info about yourself + picture

This app is being built for learning purpose ATM. although  i see great potential !
